# Mobile Robot guided using Computer Vision

Control code for obstacle detection and avoidance by 4 wheeled autonomous bot

Current Status:
1. Video input is analyzed for faces and upper bodies.
2. Central Region of Interest is defined, in which there must be no faces or upper bodies.
3. Based on the location of detected faces, the robot will turn left or right.
